    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 ball Best Pizza Dough (or Food Processor Dough or Thin Crust Dough)
      </li>
      <li>⅓ cup Homemade Easy Pizza Sauce</li>
      <li>
        4 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese (or about ¾ cup shredded mozzarella
      </li>
      <li>Kosher salt (optional)</li>
      <li>8 to 10 Kalamata olives</li>
      <li>1 Fresno or Calabrian chili pepper</li>
      <li>2 basil leaves</li>
      <li>Semolina flour or cornmeal, for dusting the pizza peel</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Follow the Best Pizza Dough recipe to prepare the dough. (This takes
        about 15 minutes to make and 45 minutes to rest.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500°F. OR preheat your
        pizza oven (here's the pizza oven we use).
      </li>
      <li>Prepare the Easy Pizza Sauce.</li>
      <li>
        Slice the mozzarella into ¼ inch thick pieces. If it's incredibly watery
        fresh mozzarella (all brands vary), you may want to let it sit on a
        paper towel to remove moisture for about 15 minutes then dab the
        mozzarella with the paper towel to remove any additional moisture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice the olives in half. Thinly slice the chili pepper (keep the
        seeds).
      </li>
      <li>
        When the oven is ready, dust a pizza peel with cornmeal or semolina
        flour. (If you don't have a pizza peel, you can use a rimless baking
        sheet or the back of a rimmed baking sheet. But a pizza peel is well
        worth the investment!) Stretch the dough into a circle; see How to
        Stretch Pizza Dough for instructions. Then gently place the dough onto
        the pizza peel.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the back of a spoon to spread a thin layer of pizza sauce across the
        dough. Top with mozzarella cheese, saving out a small bite for tasting.
        Taste a bite of the mozzarella cheese; if it does not taste salty, add a
        pinch or two of kosher salt to the pizza. (The pizza has olives, which
        also adds saltiness.) Top the cheese with the sliced olives and chili
        peppers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the pizza to the pizza stone using the pizza peel, then bake
        until the cheese is melted, about 7 minutes in the oven (or 1 minute in
        the pizza oven).
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the oven and allow to cool for minutes, then top with torn
        basil leaves. Slice into pieces and serve immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
