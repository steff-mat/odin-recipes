    <p>
      Fluffy, sweet pancakes stuffed with gooey Nutella. These feel indulgent
      and so addictive. A real treat for both kids and adults.
    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups whole buttermilk</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
      <li>10 teaspoons chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as Nutella®)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a
        large bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk together buttermilk and eggs and add to flour mixture. Fold and
        stir until just combined. Add 3 tablespoons melted butter and stir until
        incorporated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Add some of
        the remaining butter to skillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Working in batches, spoon about 3 tablespoons batter per pancake and
        spread into circles in the pan. Cook until edges start to set and some
        bubbles start to form around edges and in center of batter, 1 to 2
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently dollop 1 teaspoon Nutella in center of batter (it's ok if it
        isn't a perfect round).
      </li>
      <li>
        Dollop and lightly spread about 1 1/2 tablespoons more batter over
        Nutella to cover completely. Continue cooking until bottom and sides of
        pancake are golden brown and some bubbles are starting to form where
        Nutella is covered, about 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully flip pancakes and continue cooking until second side is golden
        brown and sides appear matte and cooked through, 2 to 3 more minutes.
        Transfer to plates and serve immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
